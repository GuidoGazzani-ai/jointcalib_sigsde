arr_calib_iv_spx.npy : np.array with calibrated implied volatilites of spx smiles
arr_calib_iv_vix.npy : np.array with calibrated implied volatilites of vix smiles
arr_strikes_vix.npy : np.array with strikes of vix smiles
arr_strikes_spx.npy : np.array with strikes of spx smiles
ell_optimal_first_joint.npy : np.array with calibrated parameters
optimal_VIX_futures.npy : np.array with calibrated vix futures
prices_optimal_SPX_i.npy: np.array with the calibrated option prices for the i-th spx smile
prices_optimal_VIX_j.npy: np.array with the calibrated option prices for the j-th spx smile


randomised_bid_vix.npy: np.array with "fake" bid-ask spreads for Vix and see the corresponding file also for spx options.
We understand that the bid-ask spreads are not as the one on the market but for data availability purposes we cannot share market data.
For the same reasons the interested user can employ our calibrated vix-futures as the market values are not available.
